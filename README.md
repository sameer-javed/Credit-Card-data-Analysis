# ðŸš€ Interactive Dashboards in Power BI

Iâ€™m excited to share my latest project, where I've created **two interactive dashboards** that provide real-time insights into **credit card reports** ðŸ’³ and **customer transaction reports** ðŸ“ˆ. This project aims to empower business stakeholders with actionable insights that can significantly inform decision-making.

## Project Overview

In this project, I utilized **Power BI** to develop dynamic dashboards that visualize critical metrics and trends. By leveraging **SQL data** and **DAX queries**, I was able to extract valuable statistical measurements and insights from our datasets.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Dashboards**: 
  - **Credit Card Reports Dashboard**: Offers insights into credit card transactions, highlighting spending patterns and trends over time.
  - **Customer Transaction Reports Dashboard**: Provides an overview of customer behaviors, transaction volumes, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
  
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Utilized **Power Query** to clean and transform raw data, ensuring it is structured and optimized for analysis.
  - Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and performed data type conversions for accuracy.

- **DAX Queries**:
  - Employed DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom metrics and calculations that enhance the dashboards' analytical capabilities.

### Insights Gained:
- Unlocked key statistical measurements that provide deeper understanding and context to credit card and customer transaction data.
- Enhanced visibility into business performance through visualizations that track trends, identify anomalies, and highlight opportunities for growth.

## Tools and Technologies Used:
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
- **SQL**: To retrieve and manipulate data from databases.
- **DAX**: For crafting complex calculations and aggregations.
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and cleaning processes.
